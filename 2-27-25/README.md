## Q1:

The cubic spline is much more smooth because it has more free parameters that allow more smooth interpolation.

## Q2:

The linear will improve because it will slowly look more curved if viewing from the same resolution. Technically the spline would also improve but you would likely be overfitting unless you know it should be cubic.

## Q3:

The cubic spline approximates it better because a sinusoidal graph should be curved, obviously a linear plot is worse.


## Q4:

The quadratic fits better than the cubic.

## Q5:

h = (C)^(1/3) = (10**-16)**(1/3)

## Q6:

It looks like an h of 0.1 (h=0.1) works pretty well for how high it is compared to C.
