	## first, divide by the diagonal element
	divisor = A[m,m]

	## divide every entry in row m by the divisor
	A[m,:] /= divisor

	## the above is shorthand for this operation:
	## A[m,:] = A[m,:]/divisor

	##anything we do to the matrix we must do to the vector:
	vector[m] /= divisor

	## now subtract multipls of the top row from the lower rows
	## to zero out rows 2,3 and 4
	for i in range(m+1, N): ## note that we start from the second row: m+1

		## because the first row now has 1 in the upper-left corner,
		## the factor by which we have to multiply the first row to subtract
		## it from the second is equal to the value in the first entry
		## of the second row
		multiplication_factor = A[i,m] 

		## now we must apply this operation to the entire row 
		## AND vector, as usual 
		A[i,:]    -= multiplication_factor*A[m,:]
		vector[i] -= multiplication_factor*vector[m]
