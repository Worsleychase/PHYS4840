    I believe one of the most influential founders of computing is Linus Torvalds. Although he isn't commonly seen as a "founder" of computing, I think he is single handely the founder of modern computing.
    Without him, it is unlikely we would have a free OS/kernel for our server infrastucture. His founding of Linux has caused an open-source craze, allowing normal people to get their hands on sophisicated hardware at no cost.
    For example, I have a single laptop at home running 10 virtual machines and linux shells (on Proxmox) that allow me to host my own VPN, media server, adblocker, password manager, and much more. Also, actual computation relies
    heavily on Linux and Linux distros. Without them, computing would take place on heavy and bulky OS's like Windows and MacOS. All modern infrastructure uses Linux (or Unix) and without it we wouldn't have any networking,
    AI, supercomputing, services, and more for as cheap as they are.

Time taken: ~3 hours
